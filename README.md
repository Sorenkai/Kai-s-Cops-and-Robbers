## Kai's Cops and Robbers

This is the first gamemode I've made, I will gradually add more features and fix bugs.  

## Changelog

v0.1 - Initial Release:
  Added robbing system and first few stores  
  Added Login-Register system using SQLite  
  Added Small admin system with a few commands  
  Added Simple class system (will change this later on)  

## Installation

Download and configure server.cfg to your liking.  
You might have to add some of the includes and/or plugins yourself as I've installed them using sampctl.
